# WpfPrimeGenerator
 
 This project is in 3 different applications. First one is a Prime number generator with a GUI, does populate a given range of primes in a list box very slowly using a simple loop with some easy logic.
 
 Second project is a python application that populates the primes quickly in a sequential way, the trouble is though the parallel method is not working.

The third project is a Console application. There the primes are found using a Sequential and a Parallel way.
The application is operated with a Main menu that work by using a switch statement, not the most elequent solution but it works.
